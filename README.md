## Lab #1
Hypothetical Political Discussion Assignment

First, I created an [edge list](../master/edgelist_pol.csv), only after I created a superfluous (*and time consuming*) adjacency matrix ([CSV](../master/politicalnetworkmatrix.csv), [XLSX](../master/politicalnetworkmatrix.xlsx)).
I easily loaded the ajacency matrix into R, but used `hRU` to convert the edge list into a matrix.

Dataset Exercises
1. Write an R script to load the network and attribute data into two objects: adjacency matrix, and vector.
      Adjacency matrix with network data, check!  
      Vector with attribute data, check!

2. Create a visualization of this network, with node colors.

      `Node colors: White denotes liberals, black denotes moderates, and red denotes conservatives.`
